Verses about fighting are often taken out of context - they were revealed during specific historical circumstances of defense against persecution.",
      "reference": "Quran 5:32: 'Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain mankind entirely.' Quran 2:190: 'Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress.'",
